# Zesty.io NextJS Marketing Website 

Marketing Website using NextJS and Zesty.io Headless CMS

## Getting Started

Node and NPM need to be installed. From your command line.

Create a file at the root `.env.local` with `PRODUCTION=false` as the file contents

```
git clone git@github.com:zesty-io/nextjs-website.git

cd nextjs-website

npm install

npm run dev

## open browser to http://localhost:3000/

```

## Syncing Zesty.io Models to Next JS

From the command line at the root of the project run:

```
node scripts/zesty-nextjs.js
```

This will create new files where needed, but will not overwrite existing files.

## AutoDeploy

Any push or merge to the `main` branch will kickoff an auto build script which will update the stage preview in Zesty.io manager and WebEngine preview.

## Contribution

1. Create a branch
2. Make change locally commit
3. Test your changes with `npm run build`
4. If build succeeds, create pull request against `main` (our stage)
